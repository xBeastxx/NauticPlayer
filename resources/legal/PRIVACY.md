**Effective Date: January 2026**

**NauticGames™** ("We") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how NauticPlayer™ handles your data.

## 1. NO DATA COLLECTION
NauticPlayer™ is designed as a privacy-first, local application.
- We do **NOT** collect, store, or transmit your personal data, playback history, or files to our servers.
- All settings and history are stored locally on your device (e.g., inside `config.json`).

## 2. THIRD-PARTY INTERACTIONS
The specific features of the application may interact with third-party services directly from your device:
- **Subtitles:** When searching for subtitles, file metadata (hash) is sent anonymously to OpenSubtitles.com API to retrieve matches.
- **Streaming:** When playing online content, your device establishes a direct connection with the content provider (e.g., YouTube videos) using `yt-dlp`. These providers may collect IP addresses or usage data subject to their own privacy policies.
